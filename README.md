## About Me
I'm a 3rd-year Computer Science student at Aalto University and currently working as a Junior Developer. My primary interest lies in fullstack web development.

I am familiar with a wide range of web technologies, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. However, my expertise lies in React and TypeScript, where I have the most experience. Alongside front-end development, I am also proficient with backend technologies such as Node.js, Express, and databases (SQL/NoSQL.

Some of my projects are available at [Dev-Portfolio](https://cankolho.github.io/Dev-Portfolio/)
